    <h3> About Me </h3>
    <p> I am Shawn. I am from Atlanta, GA. I came to the University of Miami because I wanted to be near the beach and I didn't think I'd get into this school. I am studying Electronic Media and minoring in Music Business & Entertainment Industries,
        as well as Spanish. In 2019 I worked with 19 individual clients doing photgraphy and videography. I spend a lot of weekends traveling to different cities for shoots. Outside of working, I enjoy being a travel of my own city and exploring new
        places to hang out where I live.
