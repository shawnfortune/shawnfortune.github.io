        <ul class="OverviewList1">
            <li>Surfing is the sport of riding waves in an upright or prone position. Surfers catch ocean, river, or man-made waves, and glide across the surface of the water until the wave breaks and loses its energy. In the ocean, wave riders stand up on
                surfboards and navigate the water - nearly parallel to the beach - toward the shore. There are four types of surfing waves: spilling waves, plunging waves, surging waves, and collapsing waves. The ultimate goal of surfing is to ride and
                progress on the unbroken part of the wave using a surfboard. Nevertheless, beginners can learn to surf in the whitewater part of the wave. </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="OverviewList2">The future of surfing is bright. With the advent of artificial wave pools and river waves, the sport will attract new participants in landlocked countries. Another prominent form of surfing is body boarding, when a surfer
            rides a wave on a bodyboard, either lying on their belly, drop knee (one foot and one knee on the board), or sometimes even standing up on a body board. Other types of surfing include knee boarding, surf matting (riding inflatable mats), and
            using foils. Body surfing, where the wave is surfed without a board, using the surfer's own body to catch and ride the wave, is very common and is considered by some to be the purest form of surfing. The closest form of body surfing using a
            board is a handboard which normally has one strap over it to fit one hand in.

            Three major subdivisions within stand-up surfing are stand-up paddling, long boarding and short boarding with several major differences including the board design and length, the riding style, and the kind of wave that is ridden.</p>

        <h2>Surf Brands</h2>
        <h3>and why they're imporant to the surf community</h3>
    </section>
    <section class="SurfBrands">
        <img src="images/10.jpg" alt="3rdPhoto" class="surfbrandscover">
        <ul class="SurfBrandsList1">
            <li>RVCA: A subculture that has risen out of the ashes of Billabong and Quicksilver, RVCA is a surf brand for the twenty (or thirty) year old who hasn't lost his teenage spirit and appreciates clothing that combines art, music, fashion, and a
                desire to disrupt the ordinary.</li>

            <li> Saturday's NYC: The brand for the surfer who doesn't want to look too much like a surfer, Saturday's NYC is as appropriate at a New York art show as it is in a Sydney cafe or a Torquay pub.</li>

            <li> Vissla:Founded by Billabong's former America's chief, Paul Naude, Vissla is the result of flagship surf brand execs smelling the roses and giving the youth what they want—eco friendly, innovative designs that the 'surf dads' are yet to
                catch
                on to.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="whythereimportant">The reason why surfing became a multimillion-dollar sports industry is that brands appeal to consumers' emotions and dreams in a very effective way.

            Whether inviting you to "stay high" or "live the search," corporate surfing makes you believe "life's better in boardshorts." And it could be, as long as these giant conglomerates continue selling clothing, footwear, and accessories.

            With the advent of Olympic surfing and wave pools, the sport of riding waves will likely continue to conquer new markets and segments of the population that have never had contact with surfboards.

            The surf industry is what it is, and surfing wouldn't be what it is today without the innovations and technologies companies have developed during the sport's first century of existence.</p>
